# image-recognition-model
Identifyning the Image Recognition problems which can be solved by creating CNN Models using Keras and Tensorflow.

Created a complete end to end project on colored images of cats and dogs.

In this repo, a model is created for the following: 

- to identify the image recognition problems which can be solved using CNN Models and to analyze the results.
- how to improve accuracy level by Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning.
- to have a clear understanding of Advanced Image Recognition Models such as LeNet, GoogleNet, VGG16 etc.
